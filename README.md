# less-sucks newtab

Google Chrome's newtab is annoying because it shows most-visited pages and other intrusive info. I make it less sucks. Feel free to use it.

Credit goes to [here](https://superuser.com/a/805668/691257) and [here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/396145/how-to-vertically-center-a-div-for-all-browsers#6182661).

I just make this for my own convenience.

## Installation
- `git clone` this repository.

- Open Chrome/Chromium, go to the [Extension](chrome://extension) page, and enable Developer mode.

- Then choose `Load unpacked...` and navigate to the folder containing this repo (that you've just `clone`d).

- Enable the extension inside Chrome/Chromium.
